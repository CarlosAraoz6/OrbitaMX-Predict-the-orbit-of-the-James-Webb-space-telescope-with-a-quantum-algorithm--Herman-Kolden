Challenge description:


Our solutions has the following element:

1) A slide presentation in PDF format
2) Jupyter notebooks with the implementation of a working quantum differential equation solver

The slide presentation in PDF format named "OrbitaMX-slides.pdf" contains the questions from Task 1 to Task 4 in 4 sections in the slides. From Task 1 to Task 3 we develop the answers for each set of questions and for the final Task (Task 4) we explore a practical application to a new problem using our current research about Supersymmetric classical cosmology. 



For the jupyter notebooks the output is the following:


Task 1: The fast algorithm


For task 1 the jupyter notebook is  "OrbitaMX-Task1.ipynb" we have in the fist part the problem statement, where we construct the problem theory and we set the bases for what we will do in the next parts of the coding.

Next, we consider the code from [https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-applications/hhl\_tutorial.html](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-applications/hhl_tutorial.html) and modified it step by step to solve our problem, using results form numerous research papers (references through the notebook).

Finally, we join the code constructed and simulate the orbit of the James Webb space telescope with the HHL quantum algorithm and we plot our results.

Note:Through the Jupyter notebook file there are several comments and notes for what we are doing. Also, we submit a PDF file of the Jupyter Notebook file named "OrbitaMX-Task1.pdf" for a better visual understanding in Gitgub.



Task 2: Input encoding


For task 2 the jupyter notebook is "OrbitaMX-Task2.ipynb".
Here we begin by defining the functions that will be used to prepare the quantum state, and normalize it.

Then we perform the joined code to make a quantum circuit that prepares the input state for N satellites.

Note:Through the Jupyter notebook file there are some comments and notes for what we are doing. Also, we submit a PDF file of the Jupyter Notebook file named "OrbitaMX-Task2.pdf" for a better visual understanding in Gitgub.




Task 3: Teleportation


For task 3 the jupyter notebook is "OrbitaMX-Task3.ipynb".

In the fist part we consider the code from [https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-applications/hhl\_tutorial.html](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/teleportation.html) and modified it step by step to solve our problem.

Finally, we join our code of quantum teleportation +  our code to simulate the orbit of the James Webb telescope with the HHL quantum algorithm and we plot our results.

Note:Through the Jupyter notebook file there are several comments and notes for what we are doing. Also, we submit a PDF file of the Jupyter Notebook file named "OrbitaMX-Task3.pdf" for a better visual understanding in Gitgub.
